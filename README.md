Summarize the project and what problem it was solving: This project was to create two clocks for a hypothetical company. Once clock was in military time and the other in non-military time.


What did you do particularly well? I feel like I did a really good job of laying out the code in a way that was readable and logical.


Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on? There are probably ways I could have made my code more efficient. In the future it would be nice to also be able to create clocks that actually changed by the second or even milisecond so that they could be used to keep the hour.


Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network? I had some trouble figuring out how to get the time to update if it went from 59 second or minutes to 60, because I realized that would need to reset to 0 and actually update the next higher unit of time.


What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work? I think that the most important skill in coding is organization and documentation. Writing code that functions is important, but in the real world organizations need code that's updatable.


How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable? I used frequent comments and broke the code into different functions when an item occurred more than once.
